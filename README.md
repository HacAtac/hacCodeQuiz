<h1>hacCodeQuiz Challenge!</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Dealing mainly with DOM and web api's this project has taught me a ton!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I've first targed the main and header sections with DOM manipulation.</li>
    <li>This is a timed quiz with 5 questions</li>
    <li>Then I've made 5 questions that will reward 10 points for each correct answer.</li>
    <li>Then I've made 5 questions that will punish you for answering wrong by subtracting 10 seconds from the timer</li>
    <li>Answering a question will take the previous off the screen and present with a new one.</li>
    <li>Once all answers are answered you're presented with a new screen showing your score, also prompts for initials</li>
    <li>Once you click sumbit it brings you to the leaderboard page that shows all localStorage inputs.</li>
    <li>You have the option to go back to play another game and clear the localStorage</li>
    </ul>
